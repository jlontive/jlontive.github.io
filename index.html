                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I was born in a flyover state in the Midwest. My future career prospects were limited, leading me to enlist in the United States Air Force. After joining, I successfully completed one of the longest and most challenging training pipelines to become an Arabic linguist. During my time in the military, I befriended and worked alongside a wildly diverse group of individuals across all branches of service.</p>

                <p>At the end of my enlistment, I transitioned into contracting, where I did passive geo-operation work. During this time, I met the love of my life and future wife, Elly. She was still in the military at the time, so I followed her to her new duty station in North Carolina. There, I seized the opportunity to continue my education at Syracuse University and do some awesome volunteer and professional work in Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's security and facilities department. Our small team worked to keep people and property across 14 locations safe and accessible.</p>
                
                <p>After that, Elly and I found ourselves moving north once again, ultimately settling down in Massachusetts. Now, I'm the Vice President of a charity called Thanks to Yanks and close to finishing my undergraduate degree in computer programming.</p>
